# CPP-Learning

Somethings that i cant understand in this Cpp are:

* Type Conversion
* Getline function for getting the input
* i get confused in Post increment and pre increment
* Get the Size of an Array
* References & Memory Adress 
* Pointers in Cpp
Somethings i want to remember is:

* Ternary operator is

like int nick = (1==5) ? 1 : 3;



* Get the Size of an Array
* References & Memory Adress
* Pointers
like int size  =  sizeof(someArray) /sizeof(someArray[0])
